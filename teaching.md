### "Signal processing for communications" practical sessions 

_Where: EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland)_ <br>
_When: Ongoing!_

Practical sessions were created to complement the theory taught in the course <a href="http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/fr/signal-processing-for-communications-COM-303" target="_blank">"Signal processing for communications"</a>. In particular, we go through the applications presented in this <a href="https://github.com/prandoni/COM303/blob/master/voice_transformer/voicetrans.ipynb" target="_blank">IPython notebook</a>. 

Implementations are done on the STM32 <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/nucleo-f072rb.html" target="_blank">Nucleo-F072</a> board and step-by-step guides were prepared for the students, most of whom are completely new to the world of embedded systems!

### GirlsCoding volunteer

_Where: Lausanne, Switzerland_

On a few occasions, I have volunteered in giving coding workshops to girls of ages 9-16:
* LauzHack 2017
* Applied Machine Learning Days 2018
* Swisscom event

We even made it to <a href="https://actu.epfl.ch/news/girls-coding-on-rts/" target="_blank">Swiss national TV</a>!

You can find out more about GirlsCoding at their <a href="https://girlscoding.org/" target="_blank">website</a>.

### "Audio signal processing and virtual acoustics" practical sessions

_Where: EPFL (Lausanne, Switzerland)_<br>
_When: Oct 2017 - Dec 2017_

For the course <a href="http://edu.epfl.ch/coursebook/en/audio-signal-processing-and-virtual-acoustics-COM-415" target="_blank">"Audio signal processing and virtual acoustics"</a>, I gave optional practical sessions on <a href="https://dspconcepts.com/solutions/audio-weaver" target="_blank">AudioWeaver</a> - a tool which significantly simplifies the process of designing and prototyping audio signal processing algorithms on embedded devices. For the tutorials, we used an <a href="http://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f769idiscovery.html" target="_blank">STM32F7 discovery kit</a> by STMicroelectronics, and I gave interactive lessons on designing a passthrough, a single-channel noise removal component, and a beamformer. Below are links to the slides/content:

### Assistant instructor at the Global Leadership Forum

_Where: UWC-USA (Montezuma, NM, USA)_<br>
_When: Jul 2012 - Aug 2012; Jul 2013 - Aug 2013_

I was one of the mentors at the <a href="https://www.uwc-usa.org/page.cfm?p=864" target="_blank">Global Leadership Forum</a> (GLF) - a global leadership camp for 30 youth from around 15 countries. We gave workshops in leadership, project development, community building, and intercultural experiences. This was combined with volunteer work at non-profits in Santa Fe and with a <a href="http://www.missionwolf.org/" target="_blank">Wolf Sanctuary</a> in Colorado.

### Physics teacher at Breakthrough Collaborative Silicon Valley

_Where: Los Gatos, CA, USA_<br>
_When: Jun 2011 - Aug 2011_

Certainly one of my most favorite and memorable teaching experiences was with <a href="http://www.breakthroughsv.org/" target="_blank">Breakthrough Collorative Silicon Valley</a>. For eight weeks, I taught physics to very motivated 8th graders (~13 yo) students who came from low-performing schools and/or low-income backgrounds. Not only did this experience challenge me with designing a curriculum and preparing lesson plans to keep a classroom of teenagers focused and interested, but it also tested my character as I was called upon to be a role model for my students. As part of the program, the teachers were involved with several activities to help motivate the students to continue towards the path of college. I took a group of students to Santa Clara University and also shared my experiences of attending the United World College program.

This was definitely the _most_ gratifying teaching experience I have had.
