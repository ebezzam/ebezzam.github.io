I am a research assistant at <a href="https://research.google.com" target="_blank">EPFL</a>, co-supervised by <a href="https://lts5www.epfl.ch/thiran.html" target="_blank">Prof. Jean-Philippe Thiran</a> and <a href="https://lcav.epfl.ch/martin.vetterli" target="_blank">Prof. Martin Vetterli</a>.

<br />
I have enjoyed internships in the Silicon Valley with <a href="https://dspconcepts.com/" target="_blank">DSP Concepts</a> and in Germany at <a href="https://www.idmt.fraunhofer.de/en.html" target="_blank">Fraunhofer IDMT</a>. 

<br />
I am an applied mathematician and engineer, working in the domain of signal processing. I enjoy working with analytic models that can be intuitively grasped ;)

<br />
I also love teaching and event organizing. Helping others have that "lightbulb" moment motivates me as an educator and researcher.
